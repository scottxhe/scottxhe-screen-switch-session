##Introudction

`screen` is a great tool that makes it possible to manage tabs and sessions all in one terminal window. While switching tabs is easily with done with a few key strokes, power users may find that it's not so much the case with switching between screen sessions.
`screen`requires users to  `CTRL + D`  first to exit the current session and then `screen -r my_other_seession` to proceed to another session.
This repo mainly provides simple command line based shortcuts to switch screen sessions that should faster than the de facto way.
